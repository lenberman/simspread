                PEDS
Place based, event driven simulation model
      1) relatively fine grained: people & places
      (offices, elevators, apartments, subways,
      buses, streets, parks, playgrounds, PPE, ...)
      2) graphical model
         Nodes: persons & places
         Paths: person visits places
      3) viral density field (VDF)
               diffusion and ventilation
      4) exposure (exponentially weighted sum over
      path of VDF) causes 
      5) step ~ 6 mins

Disease transmision:
 1) asymptomatic 
 2) symptomatic
 3) probability distribution:
        exposure -> infection
        a) probability of infection after spending
           NSTEPS steps with an infected person
           (VDF = 1)  is 1.
 
Simple model:

1)Infected person produces  some (default=(1/NSTEPS)/step units)
with VDF 
2)Probability of infection ~ exponential trailing average of VDF
